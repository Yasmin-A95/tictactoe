#My Aim

1.	Get the mvp version to work. Two players, both controlled by the one computer, click for o click for x, winner declared. 
2.	Build an algorithm opponent. 
3.	Build an unbeatable algorithm opponent.
4.	Give it a personality, have it throw insults at you while it beats you.
5.	Add fun animations
6.	Add a second personality, maybe one that throws Shakespearian insults at you or something while medieval Eminem loops in the background. 

I got up to level three of my aims, and went down a long rabbit hole trying to get the minimax algorithm integrated into my program. I had a great time trying it, but no dice.
