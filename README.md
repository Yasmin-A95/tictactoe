# Project AIM

1. Get the mvp version to work. Two players, both controlled by the one computer, click for o click for x, winner declared.
2. Build an algorithm opponent.
3. Build an unbeatable algorithm opponent.
4. Give it a personality, have it throw insults at you while it beats you.
5. Add fun animations
6. Add a second personality, maybe one that throws Shakespearian insults at you or something while medieval Eminem loops in the background.

Status: Up to level three. From there the project went down a deep rabbit hole when attempting the minimax algorithm as an AI unbeatable opponent. No dice.
